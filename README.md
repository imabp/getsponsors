## ⚡Introduction:
Finding the right Sponsor and Establishing a connection with them is a special concern, but the benefits are enormous. A strong sponsor relationship is also a win-win arrangement, in which both parties help each other to succeed.
Did you know that event sponsorship spending has been constantly growing over the course of the past few years? So it’s no surprise that many companies and corporations are interested in sponsoring events, especially events that are fresh, new and out of the box.
Our Goal Through **SponsorBlok** is to bring them a Step closer.

## 💡Inspiration:
It becomes a hassle to find the good sponsorship and get resources to reach out and pitch your Event.
Keeping tabs on all the Emails and Communications can also get frustrating.
Similarly, for sponsors to find the right events to sponsor and reach out to their target audience can be a challenge.
We came up with the idea of SponsorBlok as an all-in-one solution for both Sponsors and Events to establish a connection and keep their communications organized.

## 🎮What it does:
It gives you a list of sponsors who can sponsor your event, and also gives the sponsors a list of Happening and Upcoming events to get in touch with.

##  🛠How we built it
Storyblok, JavaScript, NextJS, Vercel, Anime.JS

## 🚩Challenges we ran into:
- One of the First things was the new tech stack i.e. Storyblok, we had to learn from scratch how to use and build with it.
- CSS is always a little challenging, but to create a good UI we had to overcome a few hurdles and optimize the process a little.

## 🎉Accomplishments that we're proud of:
1)We learned a lot in the last 48 hours, It helped us explore new technologies like Storyblok for the CMS, NextJS for writing the code and integrate Storyblok & New CSS libraries & terms using which we designed the Landing Page of our [website](https://imabp.github.io/getsponsors) !
2) It was a surreal experience we got to utilize our Web Development skills to the fullest, all of this while working on learning something new at the same time!



## What we learned
1. StoryBlok - Headless CMS
2. NextJS
3. Vercel
## What's next for SponsorBlok
1. First up, we will be developing on the option to have an integrated mail option to directly write to the sponsors
2. Next, we want to create an Overview dashboard to keep track of Sponsorships and Communications
